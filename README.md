Learning java

Java is a popular high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and released in 1995. It is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java is used for developing a wide range of applications, including web, mobile, desktop, and games. It is known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, meaning that Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine installed, without needing to be recompiled.
